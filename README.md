# swing_fps_game

This will be a game that combines a spider-man swinging game and an fps. Most of the project contains unity related files but if you want to view any code, go to Assets/Scripts and there will be C# scripts in that directory and also any subdirectories.

Development notes:
Go to Assets/Scripts/Multiplayer/APIHelper.cs and adjust baseURL to either local or production according to what you're trying to fix or build.
